## Introduction

This document describes how to serve the `GPT` model by FasterTransformer Triton backend. This backend is only an interface to call FasterTransformer in Triton. All implementation are in [FasterTransformer repo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/FasterTransformer). 

## Setup Environment

Follow the guide in [`README.md`](../README.md) to setup the environment and prepare docker image. We assume users already build the docker here.

### How to set the model configuration

In GPT triton backend, the serving configuration is controlled by `config.pbtxt`. We provide an example in `all_models/gpt/fastertransformer/config.pbtxt`. It contains the input parameters, output parameters, model configuration, some other settings like `tensor_para_size` and `model_checkpoint_path`.

The following table shows the details of these settings:

* Settings in config.pbtxt

### Prepare Triton GPT model store

Download GPT model checkpoint:

```shell
export WORKSPACE=$(pwd)
export SRC_MODELS_DIR=${WORKSPACE}/models
export TRITON_MODELS_STORE=${WORKSPACE}/triton-model-store
cd ${WORKSPACE}
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/FasterTransformer.git # Used for convert the checkpoint and triton output
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/models.huggingface.co/bert/gpt2-vocab.json -P models
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/models.huggingface.co/bert/gpt2-merges.txt -P models
wget --content-disposition https://api.ngc.nvidia.com/v2/models/nvidia/megatron_lm_345m/versions/v0.0/zip -O megatron_lm_345m_v0.0.zip
mkdir -p ${SRC_MODELS_DIR}/megatron-models/345m
unzip megatron_lm_345m_v0.0.zip -d models/megatron-models/345m
mkdir ${TRITON_MODELS_STORE}/fastertransformer/1 -p
python ${WORKSPACE}/FasterTransformer/examples/pytorch/gpt/utils/megatron_ckpt_convert.py \\
        -i ${SRC_MODELS_DIR}/megatron-models/345m/release/ \\
        -o ${TRITON_MODELS_STORE}/fastertransformer/1 \\
        -trained_gpu_num 1 \\
        -infer_gpu_num 8 \\
        -head_num 16"
```

We need to convert to format handled by FasterTransformer. 
If you want to run the model with tensor parallel size 8 and pipeline parallel size 2,
you should convert checkpoints with `-infer_gpu_num = [tensor_para_size], i.e. -infer_gpu_num = 8`. 
We will convert it directly to directory structure which later we'd use as Triton model store.

Then we will get the model weights (`xxx.bin`) and the config file of model (`config.ini`) in the `${TRITON_MODELS_STORE}/fastertransformer/1/8-gpu/`.


#### INT8 weight only quantization (**Experimental**)

To accelerate the inference speed of giant model on small batch size, we add supporting of **INT8 weight only quantization**. Unlike traditional quantization which quantizes inputs, outputs and weights of GEMM, we only quantize the weight here. So, the model can keep the capability without fine-tune. For GEMM computing, the weight sizes are much larger than the size of inputs and outputs, using INT8 weight can reduce the time of loading weights from global memory. For GPT-175B with batch size 1, this brings about 1.3 ~ 1.4x speedup.

However, there are some limitation for this features.

1. The INT8 weight only kernel only brings speedup for batch size <= 2 now.
2. Due to reason 1, we need to maintain both FP16 and INT8 weights at the same time to get better speed. This causes the model memory requirement grows 1.5x.
3. The results of INT8 and FP16 weights may be little different. But the accuracy of real task are on the same level by our experiments and observation.

## Run Serving on Single Node

### Run serving directly

```bash
docker run -it --rm --gpus=all -v ${WORKSPACE}:/ft_workspace ${TRITON_DOCKER_IMAGE} bash
# now in docker
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 mpirun -n 1 --allow-run-as-root /opt/tritonserver/bin/tritonserver  --model-repository=$PWD/../all_models/gpt/ &
python3 ft_workspace/fastertransformer_backend/tools/identity_test.py
```

You can modify `ft_workspace/fastertransformer_backend/tools/identity_test.py` to have different `batch size`, `input length` and `output length` in requests.

* Note: If user encounter `[ERROR] world_size (4) should equal to tensor_para_size_ * pipeline_para_size_ (1 * 1 here)`, please check that the GPU number of your device and set the GPUs you want to use by `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`. 
* Recommend modifying the SERVER_TIMEOUT of common/util.sh to longer time

#### Run GPT end-to-end serving by Triton ensemble

We provide an end-to-end example of GPT at `tools/end_to_end_test.py`. Users can run it by 

```bash
python ft_workspace/fastertransformer_backend/tools/end_to_end_test.py
```

after launching the triton server.

Regarding `bad_words_dict` and `stop_words_dict`, they should provide a single CSV-formatted string per item. The string then reprensent a list of words or expressions and each element is tokenized for further use by the model. Beware of tokenizer subtleties, for example, "word" and " word" are two distinct tokens. You can use the script in `all_models/gpt/preprocessing/1/word_list.py` to help you understand the tokenization.

#### Evaluate the accuracy of GPT model on LAMBADA.

```bash
wget https://github.com/cybertronai/bflm/raw/master/lambada_test.jsonl
python ft_workspace/fastertransformer_backend/tools/evaluate_lambada.py --n-gram-disable
```

The results would be like

```bash
[INFO] last token accuracy:  xxx% (total token num: 5153)
```

## Run Triton server on multiple nodes

### Prepare Triton model store for multi-node setup

For this experiment you need to [prepare Triton GPT model store](#prepare-triton-gpt-model-store):
- properly convert Megatron checkpoint to FasterTransformer format
- update Triton model configuration

We do suggest:
- `tensor_para_size` = number of gpus in one node (e.g. 8 for DGX A100)
- `layer_para_size` = number of nodes

Other Triton model configuration parameters should be updated as for single node setup.

Model store should be placed on network file system available for all cluster nodes on which Triton will run.

### Run on cluster with Enroot/Pyxis support

First allocate two nodes:

```bash
salloc -A account_name -t 10:00:00 -N 2
```

Then run the script shown below to start two nodes' server.
-N and -n should be equal to the number of nodes because we start one process per node. If you need to run on two nodes, then -N 2 and -n 2.
Remeber to change `tensor_para_size` and `pipeline_para_size` as suggested in [MPI Launching with Tensor Parallel size/ Pipeline Parallel Size Setting](#mpi-launching-with-tensor-parallel-size-and-pipeline-parallel-size-setting)  if you run on multiple nodes. 

```bash
WORKSPACE="/workspace" # the dir you build the docker
IMAGE="github_or_gitlab/fastertransformer/multi-node-ft-triton-backend:latest"
CMD="/opt/tritonserver/bin/tritonserver --model-repository=$WORKSPACE/fastertransformer_backend/all_models/gpt"
srun -N 2 -n 2 --mpi=pmix -o inference_server.log \
               --container-mounts /home/account/your_network_shared_space/triton:/workspace \
               --container-name multi-node-ft-triton \
               --container-image $IMAGE \
               bash -c "$CMD"
```

Then, you need to run the server on the background since it will not detach by itself. You can enter and commands `ctrl D` and `bg` or run the script above with `sbatch`.

Next, enter the master triton node (the node where MPI_Rank = 0, normally it is the allocated node with the smallest id) when servers have been started shown in the inference log:

```bash
srun -w master-node-name --overlap --container-name multi-node-ft-triton --container-mounts /home/account/your_network_shared_space/triton:/workspace --pty bash # --overlap may not be needed in your slurm environment
```

Finally, run the client in the master triton node:

```bash
python3 fastertransformer_backend/tools/end_to_end_test.py
```

You can refer to `inference_server.log` on the login-node for the inference server log.
